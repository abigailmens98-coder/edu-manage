📌 2. Grading Logic
This must run automatically whenever marks are saved:
Score Range	Grade	Remark
90 - 100	 1 (EXCELLENT)
80 - 89	2 (Very Good)	VERY GOOD
70 - 79	3 (Good)	GOOD
60 - 69	4 (Credit)	CREDIT
50 - 59	5 (Pass)	PASS
0 - 49	9 (Fail)	FAIL
Make these rules configurable in settings.
📊 3. Average, Total & Class Position
For each student:
total_subject_score = SUM(total_score across all subjects)
average = total_subject_score / total_number_of_subjects
position ranking = sort by highest average → assign 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.
Save these into:
ReportSummary Table
student_id
total_score
average
position
